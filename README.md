# Time-Series-Forecasting-Mod-3

This repository includes coursework and the final project for Time Series Forecasting.

The course focused on modeling and forecasting temporal data using statistical and machine learning approaches. We explored classical time series methods, decomposition techniques, and modern tools for evaluating forecast performance in real-world scenarios.

## üìà Topics Covered

Time Series Components & Decomposition
Stationarity & Differencing
ARIMA & Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA)
Exponential Smoothing (ETS, Holt-Winters)
Forecast Accuracy (RMSE, MAPE, Bias)
Cross-Validation & Model Selection
Visualizing and Communicating Forecasts

## üí° Final Project: Forecasting NFL Attendance ‚Äî The Taylor Swift Effect

This project examined the impact of Taylor Swift‚Äôs public appearances on Kansas City Chiefs game attendance during the 2023‚Äì2024 NFL season.

The approach involved:

Creating baseline forecasts using historical attendance data
Implementing ARIMA, ETS, and XGBoost time series models
Comparing model performance with and without "Swift Effect" indicators
Visualizing attendance anomalies coinciding with her appearances

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries

R (forecast, fable, tidyverse, tsibble)
Python (statsmodels, xgboost, prophet, pandas)
ggplot2 & Plotly for data visualization
GitHub for version control and collaboration
